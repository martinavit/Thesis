Searches for heavy neutral lepton, \hnl of Majorana and Dirac natures
decaying into a charge lepton and a \PW boson are presented.
The searches target complementary phase spaces in HNL mass, $m_\hnl$
and \mixpar, with $V_{\ell \hnl}$ the matrix element
defining the mixing between \hnl and the SM neutrino of flavor $\ell$.
The study focuses first on the
moderate and high mass searches to migrate to very low mass search with
the introduction of long-lived HNL scenario.\\

The search for heavy neutral leptons focuses on signatures with three
prompt charged leptons in any flavor combination of electrons and
muons. It provides a clean signal for probing the production of the
\hnl in a extended mass range never investigated before at the LHC:
from 1\GeV, and up to 1.2\TeV. The sample of pp collisions were
collected by the CMS experiment at LHC during 2016 data-taking, amounting to
an integrated luminosity of 35.9\fbinv. 
Organized into two parts, the search is optimized for
probing HNLs of masses respectively above and below that of the \PW boson. 
The data are consistent with the expected standard model
background. On the values of \mixparm and \mixpare upper limits are
set at 95\% confidence level. 
These are the first limits obtained at a hadron collider for
 $m_\hnl <$ 40\GeV and the first direct results for $m_\hnl >$
 500\GeV.\\

The search for long-lived heavy neutral leptons targets signatures
consisting of one prompt charged lepton and two displaced
charged leptons originating from the secondary vertex of the \hnl decay.
The data were collected by the
CMS experiment in years 2016 -- 18 corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 137\fbinv. Two interpretations are proposed considering
on one hand uniquely the \hnl
Dirac nature, on the other hand the \hnl Majorana nature. 
No statistically significant deviation from the expected
SM background is observed. At 95\% confidence level limits were set on the mixing
parameters \mixpare and \mixparm. The excluded values are in the
ranges between $3\times 10^{-7}$ and $1\times 10^{-3}$ for masses included
between 1\GeV $< m_\hnl <$ 15\GeV.
