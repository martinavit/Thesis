We study whether these processes wash out the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) generated at some earlier state (say, at GUT temperatures). We also discuss the possibility of BAU generation by the electroweak processes themselves and find that this does not take place if the electroweak phase transition is of second order. No definite conclusion is made for the strongly first-order phase transition. We point out that the BAU might be attributed to the anomalous decays of heavy (MF⪆ MW/αW) fermions if these decays are unsuppressed.}

	journal = {Journal of High Energy Physics},
	abstract = {The Majorana nature of neutrinos can be experimentally verified only via lepton-number violating processes involving charged leptons. We study 36 lepton-number violating (LV) processes from the decays of tau leptons and pseudoscalar mesons. These decays are absent in the Standard Model but, in presence of Majorana neutrinos in the mass range ∼ 100 MeV to 5 GeV, the rates for these processes would be enhanced due to their resonant contribution. We calculate the transition rates and branching fractions and compare them to the current bounds from direct experimental searches for ΔL = 2 tau and rare meson decays. The experimental non-observation of such LV processes places stringent bounds on the Majorana neutrino mass and mixing and we summarize the existing limits. We also extend the search to hadron collider experiments. We find that, at the Tevatron with 8 fb−1 integrated luminosity, there could be 2σ (5σ) sensitivity for resonant production of a Majorana neutrino in the μ±μ± modes in the mass range of ∼10–180 GeV (10–120 GeV). This reach can be extended to ∼10–375 GeV (10–250 GeV) at the LHC of 14 TeV with 100 fb−1. The production cross section at the LHC of 10 TeV is also presented for comparison. We study the μ±e± modes as well and find that the signal could be large enough even taking into account the current bound from neutrinoless double-beta decay. The signal from the gauge boson fusion channel W+W+→ℓ+1ℓ+2 at the LHC is found to be very weak given the rather small mixing parameters. We comment on the search strategy when a τ lepton is involved in the final state.}

	abstract = {This paper describes the physics case for a new fixed target facility at CERN SPS. The SHiP (search for hidden particles) experiment is intended to hunt for new physics in the largely unexplored domain of very weakly interacting particles with masses below the Fermi scale, inaccessible to the LHC experiments, and to study tau neutrino physics. The same proton beam setup can be used later to look for decays of tau-leptons with lepton flavour number non-conservation, and to search for weakly-interacting sub-GeV dark matter candidates. We discuss the evidence for physics beyond the standard model and describe interactions between new particles and four different portals—scalars, vectors, fermions or axion-like particles. We discuss motivations for different models, manifesting themselves via these interactions, and how they can be probed with the SHiP experiment and present several case studies. The prospects to search for relatively light SUSY and composite particles at SHiP are also discussed. We demonstrate that the SHiP experiment has a unique potential to discover new physics and can directly probe a number of solutions of beyond the standard model puzzles, such as neutrino masses, baryon asymmetry of the Universe, dark matter, and inflation.}

In the simplest type-I seesaw scenario with sterile neutrinos, we summarize and update the current experimental constraints on the sterile neutrino mass and its mixing with the active neutrinos. We also discuss the future experimental prospects of testing the seesaw mechanism at colliders and in related low-energy searches for rare processes, such as lepton flavor violation and neutrinoless double beta decay. The implications of the discovery of lepton number violation at the Large Hadron Collider for leptogenesis are also studied.}

ABSTRACT={The Majorana nature of neutrinos is strongly motivated from the theoretical and phenomenological point of view. A plethora of neutrino mass models, known collectively as Seesaw models, exist that could generate both a viable neutrino mass spectrum and mixing pattern. They can also lead to rich, new phenomenology, including lepton number non-conservation as well as new particles, that may be observable at collider experiments. It is therefore vital to search for such new phenomena and the mass scale associated with neutrino mass generation at high energy colliders. In this review, we consider a number of representative Seesaw scenarios as phenomenological benchmarks, including the characteristic Type I, II, and III Seesaw mechanisms, their extensions and hybridizations, as well as radiative constructions. We present new and updated predictions for analyses featuring lepton number violation and expected coverage in the theory parameter space at current and future colliders. We emphasize new production and decay channels, their phenomenological relevance and treatment across different facilities in e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>−</sup>, e<sup>−</sup>p, and pp collisions, as well as the available Monte Carlo tools available for studying Seesaw partners in collider environments.}

On the cosmological side, big bang nucleosynthesis has the most pronounced impact.

abstract = {A search for decays of heavy neutrinos was conducted by the CHARM Collaboration in a prompt neutrino beam produced by dumping 400 GeV protons in a Cu target, and in the CERN wide-band neutrino beam produced by 400 GeV primary protons. No candidate event was found. In the beam-dump experiment heavy neutrinos have been assumed to be produced by mixing in charmed D meson decays. Neutrinos decaying into e+e−ve, μ+e−vμ, and μ+μ−vμ were searched for. Limits of |Uei|2, |Uμi|2 < 10−7 were obtained for neutrino masses around 1.5 GeV. In the wide-band experiment heavy neutrinos were assumed to be produced by neutral-current neutrino interactions in the CHARM calorimeter. Here a search was made for neutrinos decaying into a μ and hadrons. This experiment is sensitive to decays of neutrinos with mass in the range 0.5–2.8 GeV with limits of |Uμi|2 < 3 × 10−4 for masses around 2.5 GeV. These measurements extend our previous results in the mass range 10–400 MeV.}

We derive, in particular, the constraints on the mass splitting of a pair of singlet fermions, and on the strength of their coupling to ordinary leptons, essential for searches of these particles in rare decays of mesons and in beam-dump experiments with intensive proton beams.}

We examine some properties of a new member of this class, for which the power is negative. This ``anti-kt'' algorithm essentially behaves like an idealised cone algorithm, in that jets with only soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal, the area anomalous dimensions are zero, the non-global logarithms are those of a rigid boundary and the Milan factor is universal. None of these properties hold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithms with split-merge steps, such as SISCone. They are however the identifying characteristics of the collinear unsafe plain ``iterative cone'' algorithm, for which the anti-kt algorithm provides a natural, fast, infrared and collinear safe replacement.}

abstract = {At high-energy colliders, jets of hadrons are the observable counterparts of the perturbative concepts of quarks and gluons. Good procedures for identifying jets are central to experimental analyses and comparisons with theory. The kt family of successive recombination jet finders has been widely advocated because of its conceptual simplicity and flexibility and its unique ability to approximately reconstruct the partonic branching sequence in an event. Until now however, it had been believed that for an ensemble of N particles the algorithmic complexity of the kt jet finder scaled as N3, a severe issue in the high multiplicity environments of LHC and heavy-ion colliders. We here show that the computationally complex part of kt jet-clustering can be reduced to two-dimensional nearest neighbour location for a dynamic set of points. Borrowing techniques developed for this extensively studied problem in computational geometry, kt jet-finding can then be performed in NlnN time. Code based on these ideas is found to run faster than all other jet finders in current use.}

We propose a novel technique, based on jet areas, that provides jet-by-jet corrections for pileup and underlying-event effects. It is data driven, does not depend on Monte Carlo modelling and can be used with any jet algorithm for which a jet area can be sensibly defined. We illustrate its effectiveness for some key processes and find that it can be applied also in the context of the Tevatron, low-luminosity LHC and LHC heavy-ion collisions.}
