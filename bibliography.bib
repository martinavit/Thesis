abstract = {It is proposed that lepton number conservation, purely left-handed charged weak currents and vanishing neutrino masses are a limiting case of a parity symmetric SU2L × SUR × U2V gauge theory. Right-handed neutrino acquire a lepton number violating mass, leaving an SU2L × U1 subgroup unbroken. Consequence for the decay μ→eγ are studied.}

	abstract = {We review observational evidence for a matter–antimatter asymmetry in the early universe, which leads to the remnant matter density we observe today. We also discuss bounds on the presence of antimatter in the present-day universe, including the possibility of a large lepton asymmetry in the cosmic neutrino background. We briefly review the theoretical framework within which baryogenesis, the dynamical generation of a matter–antimatter asymmetry, can occur. As an example, we discuss a testable minimal particle physics model that simultaneously explains the baryon asymmetry of the universe, neutrino oscillations and dark matter.}

author = {V.A. Kuzmin and V.A. Rubakov and M.E. Shaposhnikov},
abstract = {We estimate the rate of the anomalous electroweak baryon-number non-conserving processes in the cosmic plasma and find that it exceeds the expansion rate of the universe at T > (a few) × 102 GeV. We study whether these processes wash out the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) generated at some earlier state (say, at GUT temperatures). We also discuss the possibility of BAU generation by the electroweak processes themselves and find that this does not take place if the electroweak phase transition is of second order. No definite conclusion is made for the strongly first-order phase transition. We point out that the BAU might be attributed to the anomalous decays of heavy (MF⪆ MW/αW) fermions if these decays are unsuppressed.}
